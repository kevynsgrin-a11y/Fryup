## Overview & Importance
The English breakfast is a revered culinary institution. Perfecting each element requires an understanding of ingredient quality, temperature control, and proper timing.

## Essential Principles & Sourcing
When preparing a proper British fry-up:
- **Sourcing**: Select minimum 80% pork content sausages and dry-cured British back bacon.
- **Heat Control**: Preheat cast iron skillets over medium-high heat before adding ingredients.
- **Timing**: Coordinate cooked items by keeping finished components warm in a 100°C oven.

## Culinary Technique & Step-by-Step Guidance
1. **Prep Work**: Wipe mushrooms clean; half plum tomatoes; slice black pudding 1.5cm thick.
2. **Sear Proteins**: Begin with sausages (15-18 mins), followed by black pudding and bacon.
3. **Finish Produce & Eggs**: Sear tomatoes and mushrooms in rendered pan fats. Fry or scramble eggs last.

## Food Safety & Temperature Summary
- **Pork Sausages**: Core temperature must reach **75°C**.
- **Leftovers**: Cool within 90 minutes and refrigerate at **4°C or lower**.
